Intro to Data Science
==================================
I've been interested to learn about data science for quite some time now. I decided to take this free course on udacity, I hope I can learn something new upon finishing this course. This repo is where I commited all lesson exercise and final exercise.


Course Summary

Link : https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-science--ud359
The Introduction to Data Science class will survey the foundational topics in data science, namely:

- Data Manipulation
- Data Analysis with Statistics and Machine Learning
- Data Communication with Information Visualization
- Data at Scale -- Working with Big Data

The class will focus on breadth and present the topics briefly instead of focusing on a single topic in depth. This will give you the opportunity to sample and apply the basic techniques of data science.
